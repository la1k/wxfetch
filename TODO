ATPDEC TODO List

- Could be useful to read data directly from /dev/dsp

- GUI : I'm not a GUI man , but if someone want to do the job ....

- Optimisation : Don't do anything in order to run fast. There is plenty
  room for performance improvement (but on my 1.7GHz celeron , decoding
  is already faster than real time...)
